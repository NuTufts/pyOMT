# pyOMT: A Pytorch implementation of Adaptive Monte Carlo Optimal Transport Algorithm
The optimal transport problem arises whenever one wants to transform one distribution to another distribution in a *optimal* way. For example, computing measure preserving maps between surfaces/volumes, matching two histograms, and generating realistic pictures from a given dataset in deep learning. 

The Adaptive Monte Carlo Optimal Transport algorithm tackles potentially high-dimensional semi-discrete OT problems in a scalable way by finding the minimum of a convex energy (i.e. the Brenier potential), which induces the optimal transport map from a continuous distribution to a empirical distribution. The energy is optimized by gradient descent method, and at each iteration, the gradient of the energy is estimated using the Monte Carlo integration.
